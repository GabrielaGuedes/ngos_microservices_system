# Admin Front

Microservice with the front-end for the NGO admin. It consumes all the backend microservices (but the admin can disable some of them if wanted).

Before running this, make sure you have the `.env` file (use the `.sample-env` as example).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run it, use the `docker-compose.yml` file in the main folder from the project.
