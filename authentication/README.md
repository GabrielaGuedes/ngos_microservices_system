# Authentication

Microservice used to manage the authentication for admins of the NGO system. Before running this, please check the `.sample-env` file before and create the `.env` file. To run it, use the `docker-compose.yml` file in the main folder from the project.

It uses the collection `users` from the Mongo database and stores timestamps, name, email and password (encrypted), just the basic for authentication.

The access token is valid up to 50 minutes.
