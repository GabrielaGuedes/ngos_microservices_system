# User Front

Microservice with the front-end for the generic user (someone who wants to make a donation or to check the reports from the NGO). It consumes some of the backend microservices (but the admin can disable them if wanted).

Before running this, make sure you have the `.env` file (use the `.sample-env` as example).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run it, use the `docker-compose.yml` file in the main folder from the project.
