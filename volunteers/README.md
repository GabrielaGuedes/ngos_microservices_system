# Volunteers

Microservice to manage volunteers from the organization, separating them in teams and areas. Only the admins can use it.

Before running this, pleashe check the `.sample-env` file and then create the `.env` file. The "SECRET" var needs to be the same as the one from the Authentication service.

To run it, use the `docker-compose.yml` file in the main folder from the project.

## Routes

Basically, there are 5 endpoints (get, get:id, post, put, delete) for each one of the entities (volunteers, areas and teams).

### GET /api/volunteers/

Lists all volunteers sorted by name.

The authentication token needs to be passed in the header field `x-access-token`.

You can filter by `city`, `state`, `areaId` or `teamId` using query string params (e.g. `/api/volunteers/?state=SP&areaId=1`)

When request is done correctly, returns success (200). Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 121,
    "name": "A Test",
    "address": "Rua outra rua",
    "city": "Sao paulo",
    "state": "SP",
    "country": "Brazil",
    "birthDate": "1990-01-01",
    "phone": "5511999999999",
    "email": "agoravai34@example.com",
    "additionalInfo": "Top demais",
    "createdAt": "2021-04-30T14:01:29.540Z",
    "updatedAt": "2021-04-30T14:01:29.540Z",
    "areas": [],
    "teams": [
      {
        "id": 4,

          "teamId": 4
        }
      }
